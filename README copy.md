# grocery-list
A grocery list app built on rails.

During the COVID-19 pandemic my husband and I got into the habit of planning for 2-3 weeks to minimize on time spent at the grocery store. After 10 months we've gotten really sick of making grocery lists on paper. What if we could have a running inventory of common recipes and ingredients? What if we could be reminded to check the garlic or count how many cans of tomatoes we have on hand? Hopefully this makes life a little easier...
